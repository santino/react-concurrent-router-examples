# React Concurrent Router Examples
A collection of example applications using [React Concurrent Router](https://github.com/santino/react-concurrent-router).

## Applications
The available applications are built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), for convenience, and aim to deliver the same functionality with different tech stack; these are:
-  [issue tracker](https://github.com/santino/react-concurrent-router-examples/tree/master/issue-tracker), a standard React application integrating with GitHub's Rest API
-  [issue tracker relay experimental](https://github.com/santino/react-concurrent-router-examples/tree/master/issue-tracker-relay-experimental), an application using experimental releases for both React and Relay integrating with GitHub's GraphQL API
